# Revolt Translation Guidelines
Welcome!

This repository aims to host various guidelines regarding the translation of [Revolt](https://revolt.chat).

## Disclaimer
The guidelines in this repository are **not** considered official. They are made, and mostly accepted by, the community of translators behind Revolt.  
As the name suggests are they guidelines and not rules.

## Structure
Each language has their own `guidelines_<language>.md` file explaining stuff. For easier understanding is each file written in the language of which Revolt is translated to.  
This means that a `guidelines_de.md` file is written in german, while a `guidelines_fr.md` is written in french.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute to this repository by either submitting your own guidelines or contributing to an existing one (i.e. fixing grammar mistakes).

### Structure
The Guideline files do not follow any particular structure except for the file name which needs to be `guidelines_<language>.md` (`<language>` would be the short code of the language).

It is recommended to follow this general structure in the file itself.  
```markdown
# Guidelines for <language>
Short summary about this file like for what language it is meant.

## Point 1
Explain this point here, optionally with some examples to justify it further.

## Point 2
Same as point 1.

<!-- Etc. -->
